# Multiclass Semantic Segmentation using Tensorflow 2 GPU

This repository contains implementations of multiple deep learning models (U-Net, FCN32 and SegNet) for multiclass semantic segmentation of the CamVid dataset
- Implemented tensorflow 2.0 Aplha GPU package
- Contains generalized computer vision project directory creation and image processing pipeline for image classification/detection/segmentation

This repository is used to develop brain atlas for microscopic image of mouse brain.
- This code can generate below result

The edited code enabled this to generate various evaluation metrics
- ROC curve
- Precision Recall curve
- Dice-coefficient score
- Precision & Recall for each epochs
