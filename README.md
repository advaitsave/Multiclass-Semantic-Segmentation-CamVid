# Multiclass Semantic Segmentation using Tensorflow 2 GPU on the Cambridge-driving Labeled Video Database (CamVid)

This repository contains implementations of multiple deep learning models (U-Net, FCN32 and SegNet) for multiclass semantic segmentation of the CamVid dataset
- Implemented TensorFlow 2.0 Alpha GPU package
- Contains generalized computer vision project directory creation and image processing pipeline for image classification/detection/segmentation
